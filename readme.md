### Intro
This project is about exploring and gaining insights into lifting data of International Powerlifting Federation events. My first goal is to clean and explore this data in the ultimate hopes of creating a model that can predict an appropriate next attempt for squat, bench, or deadlift given a user's gender, bodyweight, and previous maxes.
